  # SPECS

Specs is a permaweb application that is a repository for common practices that empower the community to 
drive change and vote by STAMPing specs. The SPECs permaweb app gives vouched users the ability to "CREATE" 
and "REMIX" spec documents in [MARKDOWN](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) - with Front Matter.

> What is front-matter? Front Matter is a pre-pended header of YAML describing meta data for the document.

With "SPECS" you can create a markdown specification document and publish on the permaweb, once published  
the spec can be viewed using a "Renderer" - https://specs.g8way.io/?tx=XXXXXX. To provide open access to 
all users of the permaweb, so that creators and innovators can leverage these specifications as guides to 
build amazing protocols and applications to help make the community better and extend knowledge to all who 
can access the permaweb.

## How do I recommend an improvement to an existing spec?

If you would like to recommend changes to an existing spec, view the spec document that you want to update, 
then in the sidebar click the "remix" button, make your edits and click publish. You will be prompted to sign 
the transaction with an arweave wallet. Once submitted to the network, it will take a few minutes for the new 
document to be available, but once it is, share with the community and get community members to stamp it. Once it gets more stamps than any other related specification it will appear in the main spec list.

You do need to be "Vouched" to recommend changes. <a href="https://vouch-dao.g8way.io">https://vouch-dao.g8way.io</a>

## How do I create a new specification?

To create a new specification, you want to click the "Create SPEC" button in the sidebar, then you will be taken to a markdown editor, the default is a specification template suggested to follow, but you can use any format you prefer. Once finished, you can publish your specification and encourage people that use it to STAMP it.

## How to promote a specification?

üëè Yay! You have made a "spec improvement" or "proposed a new spec"! Now you need to get the support of the community. The best way is to connect with the community on the discord <a href="https://discord.gg/FGBZUxyK58">Permaweb Specification Channel</a> Or on your favorite social network. Ask them to read the specification and make recommendations, if they like it, to STAMP it. The more stamps you get, the more the community is in favor of this specification.

## Features

* List most stamped specifications on https://specs.g8way.io
* View SPEC Documents
* View related SPEC Documents - when viewing a SPEC document, you can also choose to view all of the related documents and their STAMP count
* Create and Publish SPEC Documents - Any Vouched User can create a SPEC Document
* STAMP SPEC Documents - As a Vouched User using [VouchDAO](https://vouch-dao.g8way.io/) 
* Re-MIX SPEC Documents - Any Vouched Community Member can propose an update to a version of a specification by re-mixing. Re-mixing is the process of copying the current version and editing it and publishing a new version. In order for this new version to replace the currently accepted version, the community must stamp it more times that leading stamped version of the specification it relates to. This dynamic empowers the community to have a strong signal on which versions of a given specification is considered to be the "standard". 

<div class="bg-info text-context-info text-sm rounded py-4 px-8">
It is important to note that is a version of a specification is the most stamp, there is no rule in the community stating you must choose that version, these specifications are guides not enforced rules. It is believed if we as a community tend to follow the guides we expontentially increase the value of our own work, but there will always be exceptions and exceptions should be embraced because they may show better results.

# SPEC-100

Status: Draft 

Version: -

## Abstract

This document describes a template that could be used to define consistent specifications for broad use cases in a protocol network that encourages continuous improvement powered by the community.

## Motivation 

Why create a specification standard? To give the community a basic structure to clearly describe a common description of how protocol interfaces can embrace different implementations. As a result encourage data openess and composability without prescriptive implementations. Protocol market fit is discovered by network compliance and usage. When protocols are clearly defined and easy to implement the execution is general and frictionless.

## Specification

The specification template is defined to keep the specification consistently defined with other specifications for a broad case of interpretation by the community for a variety of implmentations that encourage composability and openess.

    Version: [Version Number]
    
    ## Abstract
    
    A few short sentences that describe the purpose of the specification
    
    ## Motivation 
    
    A few paragraphs providing the "Why" for the specification, what problem does it solve, what use cases does it unlock.
    
    ## Specificaion
    
    A concise description defining the interface of the specification, examples are encouraged but it should not be long or wordy. Direct and to the point of the
    specification to implement.
